            <h2>1) Do code reviews</h2>
            <aside class="notes">
                This one seems small, but it's a really big deal.<br/>

                At Adobe, we rarely did code reviews. At AppDynamics, we do them on every commit. I know it sounds
                like a waste of time, but it really works. Apart from the short-term benefits (fewer bugs,
                knowledge sharing, etc), I have learned more about writing clear, beautiful, bug-free
                code in the last 9 months at AppDynamics than in the previous 5 years at Adobe. Reviewing other
                people's code expands your perspective and forces you to examine your beliefs about what good code is.<br/>

                When you interview, ask about code reviews. It's very diagnostic. A culture that does code reviews
                is a culture that values quality and craftsmanship. That's the kind of place where you're really going
                to learn.<br/>

            <h2>2) Get real feedback</h2>
            <aside class="notes">
                The first product I worked on at Adobe was really cool. We got lots of feedback from potential customers:
                they thought it was really cool. I demoed it in this very room a few years ago, and your predecessors
                thought it was cool too. We worked hard on it for 3 years. Then we found out there was no real market
                for it because it didn't <i>really</i> fit into anyone's workflow.<br/>

                The "potential customers" didn't mention that part. We got bogus feedback.<br/>

                The second product I worked on, we did it right. We shipped a working version with a limited feature set
                within three months of starting the project (and one month was just bureaucracy). And people really
                started using it to solve their real problems. They filed bugs! They made feature requests. And we
                did what they asked. And they liked it. And we got more users. And it was glorious.<br/>

                So I've come to believe that the only feedback that's really worth anything is people really using
                your software for their real work.<br/>

            <h2>3) Learn tech that transfers</h2>
            <p>Not proprietary stacks.</p>
            <aside class="notes">
                One of the reasons that both Matt and I left Adobe is that we had become experts on Flash, which is
                a dead technology. When we applied to our next jobs, we basically had to apologize for that.
                Don't waste brain cells on dead technology.<br/>

                I would also be wary of proprietary technology. If you work at a big company, especially one with a
                bad case of "not invented here" syndrome, you'll be surrounded by layers of proprietary software in
                every direction. It can be really interesting tech, but it has virtually no value for the rest of your
                career.<br/>

                You might think "isn't it more important that I learn transferable skills, ideas, and principles?"
                Yes, that is very important; don't ignore it. But don't underestimate the value of knowing specific
                technologies.<br/>

                Here I need to make a plug for AppDynamics. If you work at Facebook, you can learn how
                Facebook's amazing PHP VM works. If you work at Google, you can learn how about Google's insanely
                scalable database works. But if you work at AppDynamics, you'll learn about how NetFlix works,
                how Williams-Sonoma works, how OpenTable works, how Roku works. Because our job is to undestand,
                and help our customers understand, how these very complex and interesting apps really work.<br/>

            <h2>4) Stay close to the business</h2>
            <p>Sorry, this means money.</p>
            <p>Full-stack visibility.</p>
            <aside class="notes">
                If you don't mind your project getting cancelled every few years, you can ignore this section.<br/>

                When I looked for my first job, I thought "I want to work on hard problems that improve the world
                with smart people". And most of my friends had the same criteria. It's very tempting to not worry
                too much about the business. But there are some business considerations that can have a material
                impact on your career.<br/>

                First, a very harsh reality: if you're not working on something that generates revenue, your project
                is expendable. It doesn't matter what your manager says. If the project you're working on does
                not solve some real problems for some real people who know they have these problems and are
                willing to pay you to solve them, it is a slave the fickle winds of company strategy. Today
                the CTO is coming around to your cube to check on the project; what's gonna happen after the
                quarterly earnings call when the analysts want to know why you're spending 10 million a year
                on Project Frobnicator?<br/>

                Second: It's really valuable talk to non-engineers on a regular basis.
                If you don't talk to the sales team, you really don't know anything about your business.
                The same goes for operations, customer support, and marketing.
                This will make you better at your job. It will make you more valuable to the company.
                You will learn a lot. And if you think you might want to start your own company some day,
                you'll have a huge advantage because you'll know how a business really works.
                Note that this is really hard to do in a big company.<br/>

            <h2>5) Think about your second job</h2>
            <aside class="notes">
                Right now, you're probably focused on getting your first job. To me, that first job, much like the
                first day of college, felt like a sort of information event horizon: it was simply impossible to know
                what would happen after the first job.<br/>

                And it's true. It's hard to know where tech will be in five years, or where your interests will
                lie, but one thing is pretty certain: you'll probably stay at your first job for a few years,
                and then move on to something else.<br/>

                The things you do and learn (and, of course, the people you meet) in your first job will get you your
                second job.<br/>

                So when you're sifting through your many job offers, ask yourself "am I going to learn stuff that will
                make me more valuable and help my career down the line?"<br/>
